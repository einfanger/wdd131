    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        My purpose of this website is to give all travellers a quick, fun, and confidence-boosting way to explore three of the world's most beautiful cities, Tokyo, Paris, and New York City. Instead of scrolling through Yelp or outdated activies, users get a curated, modern list of the best restaraunts and activites that never feel out of style, and always hit the beat.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
        I want my audince to be people who are exctied about travelling, and want to find only the best things to do in the cities they want to go to, without the hassle of planning. I am hoping specifically for famillies, young couples who want to take a trip, and older couples who are ready to travel.
    </p>

    <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
    <p>
        My site will use a lot of dynamic JS. I am hoping to add smooth animations, as I want my website to be sleek, like the PS5, and users will be able to click on the  city they want to visit, and be guided instantly to curated lists. It will also handle themed city color changes, smooth transitions, and possibly animations such as slideshows for images.
